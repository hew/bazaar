  * [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) &ndash; for navigation
  * [React Spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring) &ndash; for animation
  * [theme-ui](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui) &ndash; for consistent, scalable styles
  * [@xstate/react](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) &ndash; state machine context hooks
